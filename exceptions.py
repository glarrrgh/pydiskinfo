"""A module for getting information about block devices in a system.

The pydiskinfo module is not a replacement for modules that gain file or
filesystem information. It is mostly a supplement, for those rare situations
when you need to know more about the physical devices rather than the
filesystems and files on them. I made the module because I needed path
information to do raw read off of hard drives. If other uses arise, I may be
compelled to extend the module.

The module depends on the wmi module, when run on a windows system. No
extra modules need to be installed on linux systems. The linux functionality
depends heavily on udev, so it will probably not work on other unix like
systems.
